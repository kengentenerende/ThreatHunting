|     Fields             |     Descripition.    |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|     1- Selected Fields             |     Splunk extracts   the default fields like source, sourcetype, and host, which appear in each   event, and places them under the selected fields column. We can select other   fields that seem essential and add them to the list.    |
|     2- Interesting Fields          |     Pulls   all the interesting fields it finds and displays them in the left panel to   further explore.                                                                                                                                 |
|     3- Alpha-numeric fields 'Î±'    |     This   alpha symbol shows that the field contains text values.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     4- Numeric fields '#'          |     This   symbol shows that this field contains numerical values.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     5- Count                       |     The   number against each field shows the number of events captured in that   timeframe.                                                                                                                                              |

## Data Sourcetypes
`Windows-TA`
- This is the default Windows-TA for Splunk and collects not only EventLog data but also registry information

`Sysmon-TA`
- This TA collects information generated from the Sysmon tool

`Firewall`
- The scenario uses a Fortinet Fortigate devices as a âNext Generation Firewallâ (NGFW). The Fortigate device in this scenario is configured to log network traffic crossing from internal to external, any alerts/blocks, layer 7 protection, and events that the Fortigate device logs

`Stream`
- Stream is Splunkâs wiredata collection/creation tool. It can capture a wide variety of traffic (including PCAPS and payloads!) on a network and turn them into wire metadata that is ingested into Splunk. The sourcetype is broken out into all of the captured/detected protocols (IE stream:dns, stream:http, etc). In this exercise, we have turned on every possible option for Stream so that you can experience the full awesomeness of the tool

`IIS`
- Internet Information Services (IIS) is Microsoftâs default webserver on Windows Server Operating systems. It will show the access and utilization of websites hosted on Windows Web Servers

`Suricata`
- Suricata is a widely used open source IDS similar to Snort. It inspects packets traversing the network and creates alerts based on signatures. In this dataset, we are using a free signature pack provided by Emerging Threats

# ELK
Elastic's ELK is an open source stack that consists of three applications (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) working in synergy to provide users with end-to-end search and visualization capabilities to analyze and investigate log file sources in real time.

ELK Stack 
- Elasticsearch â index storage and search backend
- Logstash â used to shape logs and ship logs to Elasticsearch
- Kibana â GUI frontend for search, visualization, dashboards, reporting and alerting, and Elastic stack cluster management
- Beats â Lightweight log shippers that are installed on endpoints

# ELK - Visualization

- Home > Visualization
- Click the Create Visualization
- Click the Vertical Bar > *target_log*

Now we have our Metrics and Buckets. Sample Configuration for Top 10 Agent Hostname:

- **Metrics**: Y-axis
- **Buckets**: X-axis
- **Aggregation**: Terms
- **Field**: agent.hostname / host.name.keyword
- **Order** by: Metric: Count
- **Order**: Descending
- **Size**: 10
- **Custom Label**: Top 10 Agent Hostname

Go to Dashboard and add all of your visualized charts.

Note: On the search bar part, you may see there's a **KQL** there. KQL stands for
Kibana Query Language. Make sure to enable KQL for every session for better search usage.

**OTHER INDICATORS** 

Tasks running scripts or programs from temp directories or insecure locations (writable by any user) are a good indicator for initial (malware just landed) execution/persistence via
scheduled tasks, includes but not limited to the following locations:
```
1. c: \users\*
2. c:\programdata\*
3. c:\windows\temp\*
```

For scripting utilities pay attention to tasks with action set to one
of the following (inspect the arguments if they point to the below
insecure commonly used paths):

```
1. cscript.exe
5. wmic.exe
2. wscript.exe
6. cmd.exe
3. rundl132.exe
7. mshta.exe
4. regsvr32.exe
8. powershell.exe
```

## Persistence: DCSync Attack
Fields of Interest:

An operation was performed on an object (Windows Security)
- event.code: `*4662*` 
- AccessMask: `*0x100*`
- OperationProperties:
  - `*1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2*`
  - `*1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2*`
  - `*9923a32a-3607-11d2-b9be-0000f87a36b2*`
  - `*89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c*`
- SubjectUserName|endswith: `NOT *$*`

**Key Indicators**

When `Add-DomainObjectAcl` is used to to grant DCSync rights, the following ACEs are added to the DACL and the associated GUIDs are recorded in `Event ID 5136` logs.

- DS-Replication-Get-Change
  - GUID: 1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2
- DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All
  - GUID: 1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2

These same GUIDs are recorded in `Event ID 4662` logs under the `"properties"` field when DCSync is used. Note that we have mutated this field to `"object.properties"` in our environment.

Look for the following Event IDs, filter for the GUIDs above, and group by time:
- **Event ID 5136**- an AD object was modified
  - filter on the GUIDs above
- **Event ID 4662** - an AD object was accessed
  - search for account names not belonging to domain controllers to identify user account that performed sync operations

```
Keep in mind that if DCSync is used from a DC account there will be no
log of the event. Also, even with the above indicators, further
analysis is required to identify a source IP. One method is to conduct
network traffic analysis on the DC of interest then deconflict other
known DC IPs. Another method is to use SQL to join 4662 and 4624 logs
based on the TargetLogonId value.
```

**Destination**
- event.code: `*4662*` or `*5136*`
- OperationProperties:
  - `*1131f6a*-9c*11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2*`

Reference
- [Threat Hunter Plyabook - Mimikatz OpenProcess Modules](https://threathunterplaybook.com/library/windows/mimikatz_openprocess_modules.html?highlight=1438)

An **access mask** is a 32-bit value whose bits correspond to the access rights supported by an object. Different versions of Mimikatz in the wild have been observed using the access masks below. Note that our Logstash configuration mutates the Sysmon Granted Access log field to "process.granted_access" which may be named differently elsewhere.

## Discovery: Network Share Enumeration
Key Indicators
Filter on specific Sysmon Event IDs and common named pipes, looking for local and remote domain SMB sessions.

Event IDs 
- **Event ID 3** - A TCP or UDP connection was made
- **Event ID 18** - A named pipe connection was made between a client and a server
- **Event ID 5145** - A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access

Common Named Pipes
- **\samr** - user management (SAM) functions
- **\srvsvc** - server management
- **\lsarpc** - local security authority
- **\winreg** - Windows registry

Fields of Interest:

Network (Sysmon)
- event.code: `*3*` 
- source.domain: 
- destination.domain: 
- user.name
- event.action

Pipe Connected (Sysmon)
- event.code: `*18*` 
- file.name: `\samr` OR `\srvsvc` OR `\lsarpc` OR `\winreg`
- event.action

Object Access - Detailed File Share (Windows Security)
- Event Code: `5145`
- Relative Target Name: `\samr` OR `\srvsvc` OR `\lsarpc` OR `\winreg`
- Share Name: `IPC$`
- Access_Mask: `0x12019f`


Look for rare occurrences of **source machine**, **destination machine**, and **users** - a good approach if you know what you're looking for.

Another approach is to look for chains of events generated by the net command. Benign share access looks different then if everything is accessed in a short amount of time. 

Often, attackers launch PowerShell scripts or use Remote Access Tool (RAT) features to
automate comprehensive enumeration.
```
What's a named pipe? - A named pipe is a logical connection, similar to a TCP
session, between a client and server that are involved in a Common Internet
File System (CIFS)or SMB connection. The name of the pipe serves as the
endpoint for communication in the same way that a port number serves as the
endpoint for TCP sessions.
```

## Reconnaissance: Domain Admins or Group Enumeration
Detects activity as "net user administrator /domain" and "net group domain admins /domain"

Fields of Interest:

**Source**: 
```
  net user administrator /domain
```

**Destination:**
  - Event Code: `4661`
  - Object Type: `SAM_USER`
  - Object Name: `S-1-5-21-*-500 (* represents domain)`
  - Access Mask: `0x2d `
  
**Note**: In my testing, users in the Domain Admins group will display a SID.  Other users will not. The exception is the Guest and krbtgt accounts.  I would also pay attention to the krbtgt `SID S-1-5-21-*-502`.  I would think that it would be very odd to see this and may indicate an attacker is intending to use Golden Tickets.

**Source**: 
```
  net group "Domain Admins" /domain
```
**Destination:**
    Event Code: `4661`
    Object Type: `SAM_GROUP`
    Object Name: `S-1-5-21-*-512`
    Access Mask: `0x2d`
**Note**: Also pay attention to the Enterprise Admins group with the SID of `S-1-5-21-*-519`

The following can be used to identify **PowerSploit's** `Get-NetSession`, `Get-NetShare`, `netsess.exe` and `net view`.  The `net view` command may look something like 
```
net view \\192.168.56.10
```

**Destination**:
  - Event Code: `5145`
  - Relative Target Name: `srvsvc`
  - Share Name: `IPC$`
  - Access_Mask: `0x12019f`

**Note**: These events may be very loud.  I would suggest looking for a single source creating srvsvc pipes on multiple machines within a specified time frame.  This may be indicative of enumeration activity.

## Lateral Movement: PsExec Usage
**Key Indicators**

PSExec service creation (Windows Event ID 7045) and EULA-related remote registry changes are both known indicators, however note that these can be bypassed using the `PsExec -r (rename)` flag or `PsExec Python and PowerShel`l versions, respectively.

One dependable approach to detection is to filter on the following Windows Event ID which logs the relative target name field traces of remote access to `PSEXECSVC` named pipes:

- **Event ID 5145** - A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access

From here, wildcard search for target names ending in `"stdin"`, `"stdout"`, or `"stderr"`; these strings are consistently appended to PsExec services regardless if they are renamed. Be aware that we use the field name `"share.relative_target_name"` which may be different than what's used in other environments.

Fields of Interest:

**Destination**:
  - Event Code: `5145`
  - Relative Target Name: `"*-stdin"` OR `"*-stdout"` OR `"*-stderr"`
  - Share Name: `IPC$`
  - Access_Mask: `0x12019f`

```
Did you know? - Event ID 5145 is logged when the Detailed File Share
setting is enabled in the Windows Audit logging policy. This setting
logs an event every time a file or folder is accessed, whereas the
File Share setting only records one event for any connection
established between a client and file share. Detailed File Share audit
events include detailed information about the permissions or other
criteria used to grant or deny access.
```

## Lateral Movement: WMIExec Usage

**Key Indicators**

Search for the following Sysmon Event IDs then group logs generated within 1
minute of each other.
- **Event ID 1** - A process was created
- **Event ID 3** - A TCP/UDP connection was made

When `WMI` is used for remote access, Sysmon logs a network connection and instances of child process creations with `wmiprvse.exe` as the parent process. Look for `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` child processes then investigate process arguments for potentially malicious commands.

Fields of Interest:

- event.code: `*1*` 
- process.parent.executable : `*wmiprvse.exe*`
- process.executable : `*powershell.exe* OR *cmd.exe*`
- Time
- winlog.computer_name
- winlog.user.name
- agent.hostname / host.name


## Lateral Movement: Possible Remote WMI Abuse - Mimikatz (Remote Login)
Fields of Interest:

A logon was attempted using explicit credentials (Windows Security)
- event.code: `*4648*`
- Account.Name
- Account.Domain
- process.executable: `*C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe*`
- process.executable: `*C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WMIC.exe*`
